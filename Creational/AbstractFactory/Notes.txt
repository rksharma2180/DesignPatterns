The Abstract Factory defines an interface for creating related products (a “family”), and concrete factories implement
that interface to produce concrete products that are designed to work together as a cohesive variant.

It differs from Factory Method by operating at a higher level: Factory Method creates one product via an overridable
method, while Abstract Factory groups multiple factory methods to create a set of related products via composition,
enabling consistent families and easy swapping of variants.

What is the Abstract Factory Pattern?
A creational design pattern for producing families of related products (objects).
Clients use an Abstract Factory to create products; each factory creates a set of variants specific to a context.
Decouples product instantiation from usage and supports changing product families without impacting client code.

Problem:
A multinational car manufacturer produces cars for different regions (e.g., North America, Europe). Each region requires
 specific features and standards—for example, North America cars must meet certain safety requirements, while European
  cars prioritize emission standards.

Challenges:
Ensuring consistency within each product family (car + specification).
Adapting quickly to changes in regulations for a region without breaking other regions’ code.
Supporting easy extension, such as adding new regions or car types.

1. Abstract Factory Interface
interface CarFactory {
    Car createCar();
    CarSpecification createSpecification();
}

2. Concrete Factories
class NorthAmericaCarFactory implements CarFactory {
    public Car createCar() { return new Sedan(); }
    public CarSpecification createSpecification() { return new NorthAmericaSpecification(); }
}

class EuropeCarFactory implements CarFactory {
    public Car createCar() { return new Hatchback(); }
    public CarSpecification createSpecification() { return new EuropeSpecification(); }
}

3. Abstract Products
interface Car {
    void assemble();
}

interface CarSpecification {
    void display();
}
4. Concrete Products
class Sedan implements Car {
    public void assemble() {
        System.out.println("Assembling Sedan car.");
    }
}

class Hatchback implements Car {
    public void assemble() {
        System.out.println("Assembling Hatchback car.");
    }
}

class NorthAmericaSpecification implements CarSpecification {
    public void display() {
        System.out.println("North America Spec: Safety features compliant with local regulations.");
    }
}

class EuropeSpecification implements CarSpecification {
    public void display() {
        System.out.println("Europe Spec: Fuel efficiency and emissions compliant with EU standards.");
    }
}
5. Client Usage
public class CarFactoryClient {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CarFactory northAmericaFactory = new NorthAmericaCarFactory();
        Car naCar = northAmericaFactory.createCar();
        CarSpecification naSpec = northAmericaFactory.createSpecification();
        naCar.assemble();
        naSpec.display();

        CarFactory europeFactory = new EuropeCarFactory();
        Car euCar = europeFactory.createCar();
        CarSpecification euSpec = europeFactory.createSpecification();
        euCar.assemble();
        euSpec.display();
    }
}
Output:
Assembling Sedan car.
North America Spec: Safety features compliant with local regulations.
Assembling Hatchback car.
Europe Spec: Fuel efficiency and emissions compliant with EU standards.

How the Solution Helps
Consistency: Each factory produces products tuned to its region (family).
Extensibility: New regions and products can be added by creating new factories/products; no need to modify existing
code.
Single Responsibility & Open/Closed Principle: Each concrete factory and product focuses only on its responsibility.
System stays open for extension but closed for modification.

Edge Cases and Handling
1. Adding a New Family or Product
Edge Case: New region or new car type (e.g., SUV for Asia)
Solution: Implement a new factory (e.g., AsiaCarFactory), with new product classes as needed. Ensure existing code
remains untouched.

2. Supporting Product Families with Varying Features
Edge Case: One family needs an extra product (GPS configuration) that others don’t.
Solution: Use default implementations or extend abstract product interfaces conditionally; handle missing products
gracefully in client.

3. Runtime Switching of Factories
Edge Case: Clients switch factories at runtime based on dynamic context.
Solution: Abstract Factory pattern supports this; make sure there’s a registry or selector logic and client accesses
only through abstract interfaces.

4. Client Needs Cross-Family Product Combination
Edge Case: Mixing Sedan from NorthAmericaCarFactory with EuropeSpecification.

Solution: This breaks consistency; Abstract Factory is meant to avoid cross-family mixing. If needed, reconsider design
or decouple product creation strategies.

5. Versioning/Backward Compatibility
Edge Case: Specifications change (regulations update) but old family is still required.
Solution: Use versioned factories or maintain backward-compatible product implementations.

A classic real-life example of the Abstract Factory pattern is a cross-platform GUI library that can create consistent
families of UI components (like buttons and checkboxes) for different operating systems (e.g., Windows, macOS).
Here's Java code for that scenario:

Scenario
You need to build a GUI application that works on both Windows and macOS. You want to make sure the UI components match
each OS style. Your application should be able to create families of matching components for either platform, without
hardcoding which OS's concrete classes it uses.

1. Abstract Product Interfaces
interface Button {
    void render();
}

interface Checkbox {
    void render();
}
2. Concrete Products
class WindowsButton implements Button {
    public void render() {
        System.out.println("Rendering Windows Button");
    }
}

class MacButton implements Button {
    public void render() {
        System.out.println("Rendering Mac Button");
    }
}

class WindowsCheckbox implements Checkbox {
    public void render() {
        System.out.println("Rendering Windows Checkbox");
    }
}

class MacCheckbox implements Checkbox {
    public void render() {
        System.out.println("Rendering Mac Checkbox");
    }
}
3. Abstract Factory
interface GUIFactory {
    Button createButton();
    Checkbox createCheckbox();
}
4. Concrete Factories
class WindowsFactory implements GUIFactory {
    public Button createButton() { return new WindowsButton(); }
    public Checkbox createCheckbox() { return new WindowsCheckbox(); }
}

class MacFactory implements GUIFactory {
    public Button createButton() { return new MacButton(); }
    public Checkbox createCheckbox() { return new MacCheckbox(); }
}
5. Client
public class Application {
    private Button button;
    private Checkbox checkbox;

    public Application(GUIFactory factory) {
        button = factory.createButton();
        checkbox = factory.createCheckbox();
    }

    public void renderUI() {
        button.render();
        checkbox.render();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        GUIFactory factory;

        String osName = System.getProperty("os.name").toLowerCase();
        if (osName.contains("win")) {
            factory = new WindowsFactory();
        } else {
            factory = new MacFactory();
        }

        Application app = new Application(factory);
        app.renderUI();
    }
}
Output for Windows:
Rendering Windows Button
Rendering Windows Checkbox

Output for Mac:
Rendering Mac Button
Rendering Mac Checkbox

Why This Example Is Realistic
Java Swing, AWT, and web frameworks use this concept to support different look-and-feel or platform-specific widget
implementations.
Extending to support a new OS or UI family is simple—just add another factory and product set.
Client code is decoupled from concrete classes and supports easy switching at runtime.

Edge Cases
Adding a new component (e.g., Slider): Add to all factories and product interfaces.
Not all platforms support the same features: Use default, null-object, or optional return values.
Switching family at runtime: Possible with proper factory selectors or context.

Common use cases include cross-platform UI toolkits and switchable themes where each factory produces consistent
controls for a given platform or theme without exposing concrete classes to client code

Problem scenario
A UI layer must support “Light” and “Dark” themes with matching widgets (Button, Checkbox) so that combining a
Light button with a Dark checkbox never occurs accidentally, ensuring visual consistency across the entire application.
A naive approach with conditionals scattered across the codebase leads to duplication, tight coupling to concrete
classes, and frequent regressions when adding a new theme or widget type

Solution overview
Define product interfaces (Button, Checkbox), declare an abstract factory (GuiFactory) with creation methods for each
product, implement concrete factories per theme, and inject the desired factory into an application class that builds
the UI from the family without concrete-type knowledge.
Selecting a concrete factory can be done by configuration, environment, or runtime decision, which keeps client code
closed to modification while allowing the set of product families to grow over time.

// Products
interface Button { void render(); }
interface Checkbox { void render(); }

// Concrete products - Light
class LightButton implements Button {
    public void render() { System.out.println("Rendering Light Button"); }
}
class LightCheckbox implements Checkbox {
    public void render() { System.out.println("Rendering Light Checkbox"); }
}

// Concrete products - Dark
class DarkButton implements Button {
    public void render() { System.out.println("Rendering Dark Button"); }
}
class DarkCheckbox implements Checkbox {
    public void render() { System.out.println("Rendering Dark Checkbox"); }
}

// Abstract Factory
interface GuiFactory {
    Button createButton();
    Checkbox createCheckbox();
}

// Concrete Factories
class LightFactory implements GuiFactory {
    public Button createButton() { return new LightButton(); }
    public Checkbox createCheckbox() { return new LightCheckbox(); }
}
class DarkFactory implements GuiFactory {
    public Button createButton() { return new DarkButton(); }
    public Checkbox createCheckbox() { return new DarkCheckbox(); }
}

// Client
class Application {
    private final Button button;
    private final Checkbox checkbox;

    Application(GuiFactory factory) {
        this.button = factory.createButton();
        this.checkbox = factory.createCheckbox();
    }

    void render() {
        button.render();
        checkbox.render();
    }
}

// Bootstrap (selection can be config-driven)
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        boolean dark = Boolean.parseBoolean(System.getProperty("theme.dark", "false"));
        GuiFactory factory = dark ? new DarkFactory() : new LightFactory();
        Application app = new Application(factory);
        app.render();
    }
}
This setup ensures Light components are never mixed with Dark components because a single factory governs the entire
family selection, promoting consistency and adhering to the Open/Closed Principle for adding new themes.

When to use
Use Abstract Factory when the system needs to work with multiple families of related products and must enforce
consistency among products from the same family while remaining decoupled from concrete implementations.
It becomes the preferred option when switching families should be transparent to client code, as in UI theming,
database dialect support, or cross-platform implementations.

Edge cases and pitfalls
Adding a new product to the family requires changing the abstract factory interface and all concrete factories,
which can be costly in large systems; plan for evolution using techniques like default methods on factory interfaces to
reduce breakage.
The pattern increases abstraction layers and class count, potentially raising cognitive load for teams; avoid premature
use and prefer it only when multiple product families and consistency constraints truly exist.

Confusing Abstract Factory with Factory Method leads to either under-design (single product creation where families are
needed) or over-design (introducing families where only one product type exists), so verify whether the requirement is
per-product or per-family before choosing.

If runtime selection is complex, centralize it in a factory provider or registry to avoid scattering conditional logic,
keeping client and app modules ignorant of concrete types and selection rules.

Advanced variations
A registry or provider can map configuration keys to concrete factories, enabling pluggable families; this keeps client
 code stable as new variants are added and selected by name or metadata without code changes in consumers.

Real-world examples include JDK factories such as DocumentBuilderFactory, which abstract creation of related XML
parsing components, illustrating how families of related tools are obtained through an abstract factory façade.

Give a database driver family Abstract Factory example
Here is a Java Abstract Factory example that models a database driver family with related products such as Connection,
Command, and Result handling, demonstrated for MySQL and PostgreSQL variants to keep client code decoupled from
concrete drivers. The goal is to create whole families of DB primitives consistently while enabling easy swapping of
the concrete database at configuration or runtime without changing the client logic.

Problem
A persistence layer must support multiple databases (e.g., MySQL and PostgreSQL) while keeping the client independent
from vendor-specific classes and ensuring that Connection, Command, and Result work together from the same vendor
family for consistency and maintainability. A naïve approach with scattered conditionals to construct vendor-specific
types increases coupling and duplication, making it hard to add or switch databases safely.

Design
Define abstract product interfaces for the database primitives (Connection, Command, Result) and an Abstract Factory
(DatabaseFactory) that creates each product of a family, with concrete factories for each vendor ensuring compatible
combinations are created together. Client code depends only on the abstract interfaces and obtains a concrete factory
via configuration or a provider, adhering to the Open/Closed Principle for adding new database families.

// Abstract products
interface DbConnection {
    void connect(String url, String user, String password);
}

interface DbCommand {
    void setSql(String sql);
    DbResult execute();
}

interface DbResult {
    boolean next();
    String getString(String column);
}

// Concrete products: MySQL
class MySqlConnection implements DbConnection {
    public void connect(String url, String user, String password) {
        System.out.println("MySQL connect: " + url);
    }
}
class MySqlCommand implements DbCommand {
    private String sql;
    public void setSql(String sql) { this.sql = sql; }
    public DbResult execute() {
        System.out.println("MySQL execute: " + sql);
        return new MySqlResult();
    }
}
class MySqlResult implements DbResult {
    private int idx = 0;
    public boolean next() { return idx++ == 0; }
    public String getString(String column) { return "mysql_value_for_" + column; }
}

// Concrete products: PostgreSQL
class PgConnection implements DbConnection {
    public void connect(String url, String user, String password) {
        System.out.println("PostgreSQL connect: " + url);
    }
}
class PgCommand implements DbCommand {
    private String sql;
    public void setSql(String sql) { this.sql = sql; }
    public DbResult execute() {
        System.out.println("PostgreSQL execute: " + sql);
        return new PgResult();
    }
}
class PgResult implements DbResult {
    private int idx = 0;
    public boolean next() { return idx++ == 0; }
    public String getString(String column) { return "pg_value_for_" + column; }
}

// Abstract Factory (family creator)
interface DatabaseFactory {
    DbConnection createConnection();
    DbCommand createCommand();
    DbResult createEmptyResult();
}

// Concrete factories
class MySqlDatabaseFactory implements DatabaseFactory {
    public DbConnection createConnection() { return new MySqlConnection(); }
    public DbCommand createCommand() { return new MySqlCommand(); }
    public DbResult createEmptyResult() { return new MySqlResult(); }
}
class PostgresDatabaseFactory implements DatabaseFactory {
    public DbConnection createConnection() { return new PgConnection(); }
    public DbCommand createCommand() { return new PgCommand(); }
    public DbResult createEmptyResult() { return new PgResult(); }
}

// Client using only abstractions
class Repository {
    private final DatabaseFactory factory;
    private final DbConnection connection;

    Repository(DatabaseFactory factory, String url, String user, String pass) {
        this.factory = factory;
        this.connection = factory.createConnection();
        this.connection.connect(url, user, pass);
    }

    String findUserNameById(long id) {
        DbCommand cmd = factory.createCommand();
        cmd.setSql("SELECT name FROM users WHERE id = " + id);
        DbResult rs = cmd.execute();
        if (rs.next()) {
            return rs.getString("name");
        }
        return null;
    }
}

// Bootstrap: select factory per configuration
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        boolean usePg = Boolean.parseBoolean(System.getProperty("db.pg", "false"));
        DatabaseFactory factory = usePg ? new PostgresDatabaseFactory()
                                        : new MySqlDatabaseFactory();

        Repository repo = new Repository(factory,
                "jdbc://example", "user", "pass");
        System.out.println("User: " + repo.findUserNameById(42));
    }
}
Why this fits Abstract Factory
The abstract factory centralizes creation of compatible product families so that the client never mixes a MySQL Command
with a Postgre SQL Connection, preserving internal consistency of the driver stack and enabling whole-family swaps via a
single configuration switch. This is the core promise of Abstract Factory: create families of related objects without
specifying concrete classes in client code, making variant changes localized to factory selection rather than pervasive
code edits.

Practical notes
For real JDBC usage, a similar idea appears in the JDK as family-style factories such as DocumentBuilderFactory, which
expose abstract factories that return related components to keep clients independent of concrete parser implementations,
illustrating the same creational intent in standard libraries. While raw JDBC often uses DriverManager with URLs rather
than a classic Abstract Factory, applying an Abstract Factory wrapper above vendor drivers helps organize cross-vendor
families like connections, commands, and results in application codebases.

Edge cases
Capability gaps: some databases don’t support the same features or SQL dialects, so concrete factories may return
special no-op or capability-reporting products, or the family may expose feature flags to guide client behavior without
downcasting to vendor classes.

Family evolution: adding a new product type (e.g., prepared statement builder) requires updating the abstract factory
and all concrete factories, which is a known trade-off that can be softened with default methods on the abstract factory
in modern Java.

Selection logic: centralize factory selection in a provider, registry, or ServiceLoader so runtime decision-making stays
out of client code and remains open for adding new vendors without client changes, aligning with Open/Closed Principle.

What are common pitfalls when implementing database factories
Common pitfalls when implementing database factories, especially using the Abstract Factory pattern for database
drivers, include the following:

1. Leaking Vendor-Specific Details to Client Code
Allowing concrete database classes or vendor-specific behaviors to seep into client code tightens coupling and defeats
the purpose of abstraction.
Solution: Rigorously rely on abstract interfaces and hide all concrete product details behind the factory and product
interfaces to maintain portability and flexibility.

2. Inconsistent Product Families
Mixing products from different database families (e.g., a MySQL connection with a PostgreSQL command) causes
unpredictable behavior and bugs.
Solution: Ensure that the factory produces a complete and consistent family of products for a given vendor, and client
code uses products only from the same factory instance.

3. Difficulty Extending with New Product Types
Adding a new database product type (e.g., PreparedStatement) requires modifying the abstract factory interface and all
concrete factories, which can be error-prone and breaking.
Solution: Use default methods in Java interfaces where possible to provide non-breaking extensions, or leverage separate
factories when product sets evolve independently.

4. Over-Complex Factory Implementation
Implementing overly complex or verbose factories that try to handle too many variations or configurations inline,
increasing maintenance difficulty.
Solution: Keep the factory focused on creating families and delegate configuration or connection nuances to product
objects or external configuration managers.

5. Ignoring Runtime Selection and Configuration
Hardcoding factory selection denies flexibility in choosing database vendors at runtime via configuration, environment,
or dependency injection.
Solution: Implement a factory provider or registry pattern to select the concrete factory dynamically based on
configuration or runtime parameters.

6. Not Handling Database Feature Differences
Vendor products can differ in SQL dialects, supported capabilities, transaction models, or connection pooling behavior,
 complicating a uniform API.
Solution: Design the abstract interfaces to expose common features; for advanced vendor-specific features, provide
extension points or capability queries without breaking abstraction.

7. Performance Overhead
Excessive object creation through factories, or wrapping basic JDBC calls unnecessarily, can add latency or memory
overhead.
Solution: Use caching or singleton instances for stateless factory objects and products where safe, and keep factory
operations lightweight.

8. Poor Error Handling
Database operations failing due to connection, syntax, or schema issues should be handled gracefully and abstracted in
product interfaces.
Solution: Define consistent exception hierarchies and error propagation strategies across factories and products.

9. Lack of Clear Lifecycle and Resource Management
Connections, commands, and result sets typically require explicit opening, closing, or cleanup steps.
Solution: Define clear lifecycle management APIs in the product interfaces, ensuring clients properly acquire and
release resources, or integrate with connection pooling frameworks.
